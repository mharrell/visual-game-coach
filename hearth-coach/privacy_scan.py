"""Independent personal-data detector for logs, bundles and releases.

This module is deliberately NOT the redactor. `sanitize_log` decides what
to remove; `privacy_scan` decides whether anything was missed — so that
"it's clean" is a measurement taken by different code than the one doing
the cleaning.

Why that matters (2026-10-02): the old check called `sanitize_text` on its
own output, so it certified bundles clean using exactly the regex that had
just failed to redact anything. It reported "0 unredacted BattleTags" on a
bundle shipping fifteen opponent handles.

The categories below are the WHOLE class, not the shape the redactor
happens to know:

  battletag     any `handle#discriminator` token
  player_name   a `PlayerName=` value that isn't a placeholder or sentinel
  player_entity a bare `Entity=` value that isn't a placeholder, sentinel
                or number — Battlegrounds writes every opponent's display
                handle this way, with no discriminator at all
  account_id    a raw `GameAccountId=[hi=... lo=...]` pair (stable per
                account across sessions, so it links a player's uploads)
  user_path     a local `C:\\Users\\<name>` path (docs, not logs)
  session_dir   a `Hearthstone_YYYY_MM_DD_HH_MM_SS` session directory name
                (docs and meta data, not logs)

Placeholders are the ONLY values exempted inside the name categories:
whatever the redactor emits must match PLACEHOLDER, so a missed name shows
up as a non-placeholder bare value and is reported.

#: What the redactor is allowed to emit. Anything else in a name slot is a
#: finding.
PLACEHOLDER = re.compile(r"^(?:P|H|A)\d+$")

SENTINELS = {
    "GameEntity",
    "UNKNOWN",
    "UNKNOWN HUMAN PLAYER",
    "None",
    "",
}

#: Obvious fakes, allowed to appear as `handle#discriminator` in shipped
#: text (docstring examples and test fixtures) so the release gate can stay
#: strict without forbidding documentation of the pattern itself. Anything
#: not on this list is treated as a real handle — which is how the
#: maintainer's own tag and five upstream fixtures got caught.
#:
#: The non-ASCII entries exist so the non-ASCII case can be TESTED: the
#: handles literally mean "test" in three scripts, and building that test
#: from a handle observed in a real log would put a real person's name in
#: the release to prove the code removes names.
PLACEHOLDER_HANDLES = {

    "\u6d4b\u8bd5",
}

#: Characters a handle or display name can plausibly be made of. Narrow on
#: purpose. This module is a DETECTOR: it must not fire on source code, and
#: a naive `[^\s]+#\d+` flags regex fragments (`Entity=(.+?)`) and CSS
#: colours (`--dim:#898781`). The REDACTOR in sanitize_log keeps broad
#: patterns, so an unusual handle is still removed even when this detector
#: would not have named it. Detector precise, redactor broad — that way a
#: false positive can't block a release, and a false negative can't leak.

#: A value is only treated as a person if it looks like a name (letters,

#: in our own source is not a finding.
_NAME_VALUE = re.compile(rf"^[{_NAMEISH} ]{{1,40}}$")

#: Tags that only ever land on a PLAYER entity. A bare `Entity=<value>` on a
#: line carrying one of these is a person; the identical shape under
#: `tag=CARDRACE` / `tag=ZONE` is a minion or a hero card (`Entity=Ooze`,
#: `Entity=Kel'Thuzad`), which is why "any bare name" would flag card names
#: and why the detector wants evidence of playerhood instead.
#:
#: The redactor does not use this list — it removes every bare name, card
#: names included, because consistent over-redaction costs a corpus nothing
#: and under-redaction costs a person their privacy.

#: Invented fixtures. These exist only in our own tests, and they are what
#: keeps the release gate usable: without them the gate would have to treat
#: every plausible handle in a fixture as a real person and could never
