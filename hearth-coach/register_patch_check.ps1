# Register a weekly Windows Task Scheduler task that runs the patch-notes check.
#
# Review-first: the task only writes a report to patch_reports/ and shows a
# toast; it never edits the meta DB. To apply a detected patch, review the
# report and run `python patch_notes.py <url> --apply` yourself.
#
# Run from PowerShell (as your normal user, not admin):
#     powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File register_patch_check.ps1
#
# The task runs in your interactive session, so it inherits your user
# environment. For the LLM extraction to work, set DEEPSEEK_API_KEY (e.g.
# `setx DEEPSEEK_API_KEY <key>`) or drop a meta/.patch_config.json with
# {"api_key": "..."}. Without a key the check still writes the Battlegrounds
# section for manual review.
