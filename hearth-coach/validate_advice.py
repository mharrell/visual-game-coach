"""Replay-regression harness: expected coach advice at (session, game, turn).

The validation layer of analysis/engine_coaching.md, in the validate_growth.py
spirit: for each case, reconstruct the exact state the live coach saw
(replay_review's machinery — the same incremental path as live.py: state from
game start, fire on the settled phase-start shop), run analyze(), and diff it
against the expectations table.

Cases at birth come from the 2026-09-15 session review (the four-game log
that motivated the engine-coaching plans):

  - game 4 t11/t13 (Shudderwock, 1st): the Sous Chef Sticker recipe must be
    ACTIVE and Tavern Tempest — the build key the old coach never surfaced —
    must rank in the shop's top 5.
  - game 1 t8/t9 (Tras'tath, 6th): NO recipe may activate for a hero with
    none (the anti-false-activation guard). t9 also documents the "LEVEL —
    you're strong" push Plan 3 will flip: flipping THIS case is the visible
    sign, never a silent one.
  - game 2 t6/t7 (Voone, 7th): the coach's LEVEL advice was CORRECT (the
    player under-leveled) — must not regress.

A missing session log SKIPS (logs rotate off the client) — a gone log is not
a regression. Exit 0 = all run cases pass; 1 = any failure.

Usage:
  python validate_advice.py              # all cases
  python validate_advice.py game4        # substring filter on case names
