# Hearthstone Battlegrounds AI Coach — Project Design

**Project:** An AI-assisted gaming tool that coaches a human player in real time
during Hearthstone Battlegrounds. Competes with HSReplay/Firestone stat overlays
on *reasoning and dynamic, board-specific, explainable advice* rather than raw
aggregate data volume.

**Status:** Design & bootstrap phase. No live coach yet.

---

## 1. Vision / One-line Pitch

A real-time Battlegrounds coaching overlay that reads the live board and gives
**dynamic, explainable advice** — competing with HSReplay/Firestone stat overlays
on *reasoning*, not raw data volume. Where stat overlays say "this comp wins X% at
your rating," the coach says "you have a triple pair and 8 gold — here's the best
move *for this exact board*, and why."

## 2. What the player gets

- **Live coaching overlay** during a match (dynamic, board-specific, explainable).
- **Post-game replay analysis** — full opponent purchase/move reconstruction from
  the player's own replay logs.
- **Meta reference** — a structured JSON DB (comps, cards, trinkets, dark gifts,
  heroes, minions, tavern spells) the agent consults when advising. See
  `meta/` and the "Meta reference" section below.

## 3. Why Battlegrounds (vs. Breakout)

Battlegrounds is the **structural opposite** of the reflex game (Breakout) — and
that's exactly what an LLM-based coach wants:

| | Breakout (past work) | Battlegrounds |
|---|---|---|
| Tempo | Real-time reflex | Turn-based, decision-timed |
| State | Continuous frame stream | One readable board screenshot per decision |
| Good play | Mechanical tracking | Strategic, verbal reasoning |
| Coaching output | "Move right now" | "Buy this, level next, pivot to X" |

No reflex/latency pressure. Coaching is *linguistic* — an LLM strength.

## 4. Target Architecture (hybrid)

```
                    +-----------------------------------------------+
                    |                COACH AGENT (LLM)             |
                    |  reasoning over (state + meta + stats)       |
                    +------+------------------+--------------------+
                           |                  |

      | (from Power.log |          |  comps, cards, trinkets,|
      |  or screen OCR) |          |  dark gifts, heroes,   |
      +----------------+          |  minions, tavern spells)|
                           ^       +-----------------------+
                           | optional
              +-----------------------+
              |  HSReplay public API   |
              |  (aggregate stats, if  |
              |  accessible)           |
              +-----------------------+
```

**Two context layers:**
1. **Live board state** (the "specific situation"): tier, gold, board, rolls,
   hero, opponents' visible board/tier, and the per-game family ban.
2. **Meta knowledge (the "general knowledge"):** the structured meta reference
   (comp meta, card details, trinket/hero/minion/spell data), plus optionally
   live HSReplay aggregate stats.

The coach reasons over both simultaneously.

### Design decision — meta reference source (LOCKED)
**A structured JSON DB** in `meta/` (comps, cards, trinkets, dark gifts, heroes,
minions, tavern spells), built from hsreplay pages + the hearthstonejson card DB
+ the wiki.gg tavern-spell page. Refreshed manually on patches. The coach loads
the relevant subset per decision. Self-owned; no dependence on HSReplay's API
(which is Cloudflare-protected for minions/heroes/dark-gifts — those are captured
via manual paste).

### Model & cache strategy — two distinct things
**1. The Claude Code session (the tool building the coach) runs on
`deepseek-v4-flash`** (1M context) with prefix-cache discipline. That's the
harness config in `~/.claude/settings.json` — it powers *this* agent, not the
coach's runtime. Cache discipline: byte-stable FIXED_BLOCK + per-decision
VARIABLE tail; verify via `prompt_cache_hit_tokens` vs `prompt_cache_miss_tokens`.

**2. The coach's advice model is a separate, OPEN decision** (see ROADMAP
"Open decisions"). It was never locked. `coach_llm.py` is a DeepSeek v4 flash
client that exists in the repo (kept) but is **not** the intended advice engine
at this time. The coach's reasoning model — hosted API vs local vision-capable
model — is still to be chosen.

### Domain constraint — family ban (LOCKED)
Each Battlegrounds game allows **exactly 5 tribes** and bans the other 5
(verified across the user's recent replays). A comp is playable only if **every
core card has at least one tribe in the allowed set** — so filter by each core
card's full tribe set, not the comp's `tribe` field (a Demon deck with a Pirate
core card is unavailable when Pirates are banned). `All`/`Neutral` cards are
never-banned; compound cards (e.g. `Demon/Quilboar`) are playable if *either*
tribe is allowed. Detection: the 5 allowed tribes are the **pure single-tribe
minions** in the tavern pool (`BACON_POOL_MINION`); compound minions appear if
any tribe is active, so they can't reveal bans. Implemented in `bans.py`
(`bans_from_log`, `filter_comps_by_available_tribes`). See memory
`hearth-family-ban`.

## 4. The Data Asset: Opponent Observation from Own Replays

### Thesis
Each Hearthstone `Power.log` game contains the **full move stream of all 8
players** (hero, purchases, sells, tiers, placement). So each game you play
yields **~8 decision trajectories**, not just your own.

### Why it's valuable
- **8x per-game yield.** Each replay contains the complete decisions of you +
  7 opponents.
- **More than HDT persists.** HDT's own local cache (`BgsLastGames.xml`) stores
  only *your own* final board + placement — **no opponent data**. Your raw
  `Power.log` is richer than the tracker's cache.
- **Not exposed by HSReplay's API.** HSReplay only surfaces aggregate stats; raw
  replays are their proprietary asset. So your own logs are the only way to get
  opponent-level detail.

### What it enables
- MMR-localized coaching (your opponents are near your rating).
- Opponent-modeling as a feature (common patterns at your MMR band).
- A full-time-stream training set (state buckets -> outcome win-tables).

### Honest caveats (breakoutBot discipline)
- **Volume still scales with games played.** Per-game efficiency is 8x, but raw
  volume depends on install base / games played.
- **Observational, not causal.** Placement is confounded by 7 players + shop
  randomness. "Players who took X placed better" is a correlation. Needs
  bucketing + outcome tables, and sham-control on any "advice improves placement"
  claim (the same dead-model-calibration habit from the breakoutBot project).

### Where the data lives
- Hearthstone session logs: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Hearthstone\Logs\`
  `Hearthstone_<timestamp>\Power.log` (or `Power_old.log` after rotation).
- Format: standard Power.log with `CREATE_GAME`, `GAME_SEED`, `BACON_*` tags,
  `TAG_PLAYSTATE`, `SHOW_ENTITY`/`CardID`, `TECH_LEVEL`.
- Parser: **`python-hslog`** (official HearthSim, MIT, Python) — the same parser
  HDT uses. Cloned into `python-hslog/`.

### Validation task (parked / to-do)
Split one `Power.log` into games and extract per-player move stream (hero,
placement, purchases, tiers). Confirms the opponent-data thesis. See
`parse_bg.py` (smoke test) and `analysis/OPPONENT_DATA.md`.

## 5. Market / Competitor Landscape

### How HSReplay & Vicious Syndicate get their data
**Crowdsourced from opt-in users, not mined from Blizzard.**
- HSReplay (HearthSim): users install Hearthstone Deck Tracker / Firestone and
  opt in to "replay upload." HDT reads Hearthstone's own logs from the game
  install folder and uploads anonymized replays to HSReplay.net. HearthSim
  processes/aggregates millions of games. Sources:
  - https://hearthsim.info/blog/how-we-process-replays/
  - https://github.com/HearthSim/legal/blob/.../PRIVACY.md
- Vicious Syndicate: same model via their app; they pay a small group of
  high-MMR "contributors" for a ranked, high-skill sample.

### What the app stores locally vs. what it fetches live
Inspected the installed HDT app (`AppData\Roaming\HearthstoneDeckTracker`):
- **Live from API (not stored):** win-rates, tier lists, meta stats. Tiny
  transient cache (`hsreplay_winrates.cache` ~667 bytes with `ServerTimeStamp`).
- **Stored locally:** `BgsLastGames.xml` (own recent BG games, final board only,
  **no opponent data**), `Replays/` (constructed `.hdtreplay` files, own games),
  `hsreplay.cache` (account token), `Images/` (card art), auth tokens.

### Can we get their data?
- **Aggregate stats:** HSReplay has a public API (aggregated stats only). BG-specific
  coverage in the *public* API is uncertain — verify against their api-docs.
- **Raw replays:** not available from either. Own opt-in upload loop is the only
  way to build your own corpus.

### The moat and how we position
- We can't out-compete them on raw aggregate volume (years of contributed replays).
- **We can win on reasoning, dynamic board adaptation, and explainability** — they
  don't do that at all.

## 6. Meta Reference (structured DB) — LOCKED

**Source:** a structured JSON DB in `meta/`, built from hsreplay pages + the
hearthstonejson card DB + the wiki.gg tavern-spell page.
**Refresh:** manual on patches (re-run the scrapers / re-paste Cloudflare-gated
data). Balance changes can be applied from official patch notes with
`patch_notes.py <url>` (fetches the page, LLM-extracts before/after changes,
dry-runs by default; `--apply` writes them). New cards still need manual entry
(patch notes don't carry internal card IDs).
**Per-decision fetch:** the coach loads the relevant subset per decision (e.g.,
comps filtered by the family ban; the hero-rank list on hero-select).

### The assets (`meta/`)
| File | Contents |
|------|----------|
| `comps.json` | 20 comps (tier, difficulty, core/addon cards, how-to-play, when-to-commit) |
| `cards.json` | 89 curated cards (name, tier, tribe, atk/health) |
| `trinkets.json` | 121 Lesser Trinkets (pick rate, avg placement, distribution, guide) |
| `dark_gifts.json` | 43 dark gifts (name, description) |
| `heroes.json` | 115 heroes (hero power, pick rate) |
| `minions.json` | 245 minions by tavern tier, with full card details |
| `tavern_spells.json` | 72 tavern spells by tier, with cost + text |
| `guides/` | comp guides mined from commentary transcripts |

### Honest design notes
- **Staleness:** the meta is point-in-time. Treat as refreshable assets, not live
  data. The comps tier list updates frequently (the newest tier change was ~22h
  old when last checked); rescrape when the meta moves.
- **Source access:** hsreplay embeds comps/trinkets data in HTML (scrapable), but
  minions/heroes/dark-gifts load via a **Cloudflare-protected API** — those are
  captured via manual paste. The wiki.gg tavern-spell page is accessible and
  supplies the spell tier grouping.
- **Token/cost + latency:** the full meta is small (~tens of KB), so it fits in
  the cached prefix; per-decision subsetting is for relevance, not size.
- **Complements, not replaces** the live board reasoning.

### Model vision limitation (current)
The current agent model (deepseek-v4-flash:cloud) **does not accept images yet**.
The eventual coach agent may use a vision-capable model or the hosted DeepSeek
API (verify whether the hosted API accepts `image_url` in `content`). See
`analysis/DEEPSEEK_VISION.md` for what we know.

---

## 8. DeepSeek Vision / Model capability (current knowledge)

- Open-source vision model: [DeepSeek-VL](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-vl)
  (and paper https://arxiv.org/html/2403.05525v2). Current V-series line includes
  vision-capable variants (e.g., a "DeepSeek V4 Flash Vision" build — third-party
  source). Official [DeepSeek-V3.1](https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3.1)
  has multimodal variants.
- **Hosted API image-input is the thing to confirm** against authoritative
  https://api-docs.deepseek.com/api/create-chat-completion and the change log.
  Historically the July 2025 API upgrade covered text tools (JSON output, function
  calling, FIM); vision support has been rolling out around/after that.
- **Recommendation:** verify whether the hosted API accepts an `image_url`
  `content` part before committing architecture.

## 9. Setup & Infrastructure Status

- Working dir: `C:\Users\Silver Pangolin\PycharmProjects\visual-game-coach`
  (repo project folder: `hearth-coach/`).
- Cloned `python-hslog/` (official HearthSim parser).
- `.venv` created; `requests` available (no SDK install needed for the LLM client).
- **Tools built:**
  - `parse_bg.py` / `extract_game.py` — Power.log → per-game player/hero/placement.
  - `board_state.py` — Power.log → friendly final board + hand + hero state.
  - `bans.py` — Power.log → per-game 5 allowed / 5 banned tribes; comp filter.
  - `scrape_comps.py` — hsreplay comp pages → `comps.json` (`--top N`, `--prune`).
  - `coach_llm.py` — DeepSeek v4 flash client with prefix-cache discipline.
  - `parse_trinkets.py` / `parse_minions.py` — meta raw pastes → JSON.
- **Meta reference:** complete in `meta/` (see section 6).

### Network situation
- Network is up (scraping hsreplay/wiki works). hsreplay's minions/heroes/
  dark-gifts APIs are Cloudflare-protected (403) — those meta assets come from
  manual paste; the comps/trinkets pages and the wiki are scrapable.

### Harness / headless notes
- `dsh --profile headless` is how to run a fresh agent from the CLI.
- Headless needs a `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` in its launching environment (it does NOT
  inherit the GUI's key). The GUI Models page is the credentials service. Not yet
  wired for headless runs.
- The GUI model does not accept images.

---

## 10. Known Pitfalls / Decisions to Respect (from breakoutBot experience)

1. **Verify what a vision model actually reads** before trusting image-derived
   advice (dead-model/confound discipline).
2. **Don't attribute an outcome to one variable** without listing others.
3. **Observational data is not causal** — bucket + control before claiming
   coaching improves placement.
4. **Design decisions before implementation** (project habit).
5. **NoopResetEnv-style timing confounds** — for BG the analog is matching hidden
   game state (opponents' shops) which the game intentionally hides.

---

## 11. Open Questions

- Does the hosted DeepSeek API accept images? If not, use a vision-capable model.
- How to do the live board parse: from Power.log (authoritative) vs. screen OCR.
- How to measure coaching effectiveness rigorously (sham-control design).
- Latency/cost budget per decision point.
- (Resolved) Meta source: structured JSON DB in `meta/`; hsreplay's
  minions/heroes/dark-gifts APIs are Cloudflare-protected, so those come from
  manual paste; the wiki supplies the tavern-spell tier grouping.

## 12. Next Steps (see ROADMAP.md)
