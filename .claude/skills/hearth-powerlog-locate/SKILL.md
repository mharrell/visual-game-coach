# Locate Hearthstone Session Logs (Power.log)

Hearthstone writes per-session logs under its install directory on Windows.
Use this to find the raw game data for the Battlegrounds AI coach.

## Where the logs live

```
C:\Program Files (x86)\Hearthstone\Logs\Hearthstone_<timestamp>\
```

Each `Hearthstone_<timestamp>` folder is one launch session. The raw game data
is in **`Power.log`** (or `Power_old.log` after rotation at the next session).

Typical sizes: 30–250 MB per session. Recent sessions may have several.

## Key files

| File | Contents |
|------|----------|
| `Power.log` / `Power_old.log` | The full per-game action stream (gold mine) |
| `Achievements.log`, `Hearthstone.log` | Not needed for parsing |
| `All.log` | Concatenated log (if present) |

## Identify the newest session

List sessions and their Power logs by modification time:

```powershell
$root = "C:\Program Files (x86)\Hearthstone\Logs"
Get-ChildItem $root -Directory | Sort-Object Name | Select-Object Name
Get-ChildItem $root -Recurse -Include "Power.log","Power_old.log" |
  ForEach-Object { "{0}  {1:N1} MB  {2}" -f $_.Directory.Name, ($_.Length/1MB), $_.LastWriteTime }
```

## Confirm a session contains games

Count `CREATE_GAME` markers in a Power file:

```powershell
(Select-String -Path <PowerFile> -Pattern 'CREATE_GAME' | Measure-Object).Count
```

Each `CREATE_GAME` is one match. Battlegrounds games also contain `BACON_*`
tags and a `GAME_SEED` value.

## Distinguish your account

Your player name (e.g. `MikeySCE#1712`) appears in `PLAYSTATE` tag changes and
`DebugPrintGame` lines (`PlayerName=MikeySCE#1712`). Use it to identify which
of the 8 players is you.
